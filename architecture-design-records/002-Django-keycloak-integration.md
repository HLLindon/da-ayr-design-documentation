# django keycloak integration

Date: 12-12-2022

## Status

In Progress

## Context

[Keycloak](http://www.keycloak.org/) is an open source identity and access management (IAM) and single sign on (SSO) solution from Redhat. If you have multiple web applications or services that require authentication, keycloak saves you from having to write the same authentication code over and over again, and allows your users to authenticate against multiple applications without having to log in multiple times.

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.
