# django keycloak integration

Date: 15-12-2022

## Status

In Review

## Context

[Keycloak](http://www.keycloak.org/) is an open source identity and access management (IAM) and single sign on (SSO) solution from Redhat. If you have multiple web applications or services that require authentication, keycloak saves you from having to write the same authentication code over and over again, and allows your users to authenticate against multiple applications without having to log in multiple times.

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.

## Decision

The team were evaluating two libraries:

- [django-allauth](https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth)
- [mozilla-django-oidc](https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-django-oidc)

The recommendation is to use the `mozilla-django-oidc` library: 
* it is an opensource library from the mozilla community, 
* it is released under the MPL 2.0 license, 
* it is maintained by the community 
* and the latest release is `3.0.0` from 14th of Nov 2022.

## Consequences

This [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nationalarchives/da-ayr-webapp) will be used to implement the integration.
